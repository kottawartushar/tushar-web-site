# Project Title

Bug Governance System

**Organization / Client:** Ad Astra Consultants / Google

**Duration:**  April 2024 – August 2024

**Role:**  Data Analyst

**Domain / Focus Area:**  Bug Governance, Process Optimization

---

## 🧩 Project Context

As part of Google Maps’ Trust & Safety operations, I developed a data-driven Bug Governance System to bring transparency and accountability to the bug resolution process.

The project aimed to establish a centralized tracking and alerting framework that monitored bug inflow, outflow, and SLA adherence through interactive dashboards, automated email alerts, and bi-weekly performance reviews.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

The Trust & Safety team faced an escalating bug backlog with no structured mechanism to monitor issue inflow, resolution timelines, or SLA adherence.

Fragmented reporting practices and the absence of key performance metrics such as open duration, closure rates, and backlog trends limited visibility and accountability.

This lack of governance led to delayed resolutions, missed SLAs, and inefficiencies in resource allocation — requiring a systematic, data-driven solution to streamline bug management and improve operational performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Develop a centralized bug tracking framework** to consolidate data from multiple sources and establish visibility across inflow, outflow, and resolution trends.

2. **Design an interactive dashboard in Plx** to monitor key performance indicators such as backlog volume, SLA adherence, and bug lifecycle metrics.

3. **Implement an automated alerting mechanism** in Plx to notify analysts when assigned bugs breach defined service-level objectives (SLOs).

4. **Facilitate bi-weekly operational reviews** through Google Sheets extracts to analyze SLA breaches, identify root causes, and reprioritize workloads.

5. **Reduce bug backlog volume** and improve turnaround efficiency through real-time insights, proactive tracking, and data-driven accountability.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

1. **Plx (SQL Scripts)** — for data extraction, transformation, and creation of a unified dataset to track bug inflow, outflow, and resolution trends.
2. **Plx Dashboards** — for building interactive visualizations to monitor key KPIs such as backlog volume, open duration, and SLA adherence.
3. **Plx Alerts** — for automated email notifications to analysts when assigned bugs breach defined service-level objectives (SLOs).
4. **Google Sheets** — for exporting weekly and bi-weekly reports to support operational review meetings and root cause analysis.

---

## 🔧 Methodology / Approach

1. **Requirement Understanding:** Collaborated with a peer mentor to define key metrics and KPIs, determine relevant data sources, and finalize dashboard design elements such as charts and visual indicators.

2. **SQL Script Development:** Created a complex SQL query in Plx to consolidate data from multiple sources, calculate bug inflow/outflow rates, resolution timelines, and SLA adherence for each priority level (P0–P4).

3. **Dashboard Design & Development:** Designed an interactive Plx dashboard to visualize real-time trends — including open duration, backlog movement, and SLA compliance — enabling transparent monitoring and decision-making.

4. **Alert Configuration:** Implemented automated Plx email alerts to notify analysts when bugs exceeded assigned SLO thresholds, ensuring timely escalation and accountability.

5. **Performance Review Cadence:** Extracted summarized reports into Google Sheets and led bi-weekly review discussions with the operations team to analyze SLA breaches, identify root causes (bandwidth constraints, incorrect prioritization, high inflow), and plan mitigation strategies.

## 📦 Key Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive SQL Data Model:** Developed a robust SQL script in Plx to unify bug data from multiple sources, define consistent KPIs (inflow, outflow, open duration, SLA adherence), and enable automated tracking across priorities (P0–P4).

2. **Interactive Bug Governance Dashboard:** Designed and deployed an end-to-end Plx dashboard providing real-time visibility into bug backlog, resolution rates, and SLA compliance — allowing teams to monitor progress and identify trends at a glance.

3. **Automated Alerting Mechanism:** Configured Plx email alerts to proactively notify analysts when bugs exceeded their assigned SLOs, helping reduce response delays and improve accountability.

4. **Operational Review Framework:** Established a bi-weekly reporting cadence using Google Sheets extracts to review SLA breaches, discuss root causes, and refine prioritization strategies with the operations team.

---

## 📊 Results / Impact

1. **Reduced bug backlog volume by 84%** within five months through systematic tracking, proactive monitoring, and timely escalation.

2. **Improved SLA adherence by 40%**, ensuring critical issues (P0–P2) were addressed within defined timelines and reducing operational delays.

3. **Enhanced visibility into bug lifecycle metrics**, enabling data-driven decision-making and accountability across teams.

4. **Accelerated reporting and review cadence**, transitioning from reactive issue management to proactive backlog prevention.

5. **Established a sustainable governance framework**, integrating dashboards, alerts, and operational reviews for continuous improvement.

## ⚙️ Challenges & Learnings

**Challenges:**

1. **Fragmented Data Sources:** Bug-related data was distributed across multiple systems with inconsistent structures, requiring extensive validation and consolidation to ensure accuracy.

2. **High Bug Inflow and Bandwidth Constraints:** Frequent surges in bug inflow combined with limited analyst bandwidth often caused temporary backlog spikes and delayed resolutions.

3. **Prioritization Gaps:** Incorrect or inconsistent bug prioritization occasionally led to SLA breaches despite timely detection through the dashboard and alerts.

4. **Dependency on Cross-Team Coordination:** Alert configuration and dashboard refinements depended on inputs from different teams, making coordination and approvals a key operational challenge.

**Key Learnings:**

1. Strengthened ability to design governance frameworks that integrate analytics, automation, and accountability across operational workflows.

2. Enhanced proficiency in SQL optimization and alert automation using Plx, improving both data accuracy and process efficiency.

3. Developed deeper business context awareness, learning to balance operational constraints (bandwidth, inflow) with analytical rigor.

4. Improved cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder alignment, ensuring the analytics output directly informed decision-making and backlog mitigation.
